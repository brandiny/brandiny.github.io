My name is Brandon Ru. I've been interested in computers since I was a child, and continue to explore them to this day.
I also enjoy exploring a variety of areas: mathematics, economic theory, psychology, philosophy, music, and just cool stuff in general. I like to build neat things for fun.

I am currently completing a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) at Victoria University of Wellington.
