title: 2023 Books

This year I'm trying to read more, and I'll try to share what I get up to here.
I'll write about the books I've read in my spare time, and for university.
So far, I've munched down 20 books, to my surprise. Reading has helped me significantly broaden my thinking, as well as offer a way to slow down life. I realised this when I started unexpectedly reading during the exam period.
